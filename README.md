## Step 2
Instead of signaling server is used [broadcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking))<br />
Usually it's enough to connect both devices to one wi-fi access point<br />
For the emulator will have to play around with the settings<br />

## Step 3
Wait up to 20 seconds<br />
If the ip address was determined WebRTC will show the magic<br />
If not, specify ip address manually in the `partnerIp` field<br />
